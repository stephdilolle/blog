## "My First Blog" Challenge 4

## Description

I have created a two-page blog that allows the user to enter a blog post that will then be saved to local storage and available to view on the next page. Both pages also include a toggle between light and dark modes. I learned how to create the light/dark toggle and how to connect 2 web pages in VS Code.

## Usage

To use the web page, the user will type in their username, a title, and a blog post. When they hit submit, they are taken to the next page where the blog posts are pulled from localStorage and displayed on the page.
